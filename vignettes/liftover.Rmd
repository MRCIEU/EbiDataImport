There are three ways to determine the build of a dataset:

- `determine_build` - Lookup build against a selected number of HM3 SNPs, matching by rsid
- `determine_build_position` - Lookup build against a selected number of HM3 SNPs, matching by chromosome and position
- `determine_build_biomart` - Lookup positions on biomaRt

The `liftover_gwas` function determines the build using each of those options, and then performs the liftover automatically.
