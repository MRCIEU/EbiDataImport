\title{Determine build just from positions}
\usage{
determine_build_position(pos, build = c(37, 38, 36))
}
\arguments{
\item{pos}{Vector of positions}

\item{build}{c(37,38,36)}

\item{threshold}{how many times more in the true build than the others. default = 50}
}
\value{
build or if not determined then dataframe
}
\description{
A bit sketchy but computationally fast - just assumes that there will be at least 50x more position matches in the true build than either of the others.
